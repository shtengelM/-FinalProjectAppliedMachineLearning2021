Students:
Guy Zamostiano, Maayan Shtengel

This project's topic is evaluation of perforamce of the method introduced in the paper:

“Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning for Tabular Datasets” 
by: 	
Ira Shavitt  Weizmann Institute of Science
Eran Segal Weizman Institute of Science

arXiv:1805.06440v3 [stat.ML] 23 Oct 2018
https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06440

based on the papar's code: https://github.com/irashavitt/regularization_learning_networks


How to run the code:
The code is a Jupter Notebook that can be run.

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION:
In the running there will be a request to give a code for accessing the google drive (by a link) where the results will be uploaded.
This is done in the first block of code in the notebook:
"auth.authenticate_user()"
(Everyone should have access to the drive)
If you will not enter the code, the running will not continue.
